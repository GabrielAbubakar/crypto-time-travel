# Crypto Time Travel


## Overview:

- Crypto Time Travel is a crypto-currency value growth aggregator application.
- Its major functionality is the receipt of a date in the past, a price in USD and a specific crypto-currency from a user
- It uses this information to communicate with the Coin Gecko API and gets the current price of queried crypto currency in USD.
- Price and percentage increase or decrease in value will be computed on the client side and the result will be rendered in cards for the user to see

## User Flow
